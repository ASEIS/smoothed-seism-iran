\section{Discussion of Results}
Seismic hazard in northern Iran is computed based on background seismicity and projected on a set of hazard maps. The results obtained are represented as maps for the spatial distribution of horizontal peak ground acceleration with 10\% and 2\% probability of exceedance in 50 years, which correspond to the return period of 475 and 2475 years. The areas of large probabilistic ground motions clearly coincide with zones with a large number of events of magnitude 3.0 and larger. In this study we used two model for seismic hazard calculation, including $M>5$ and $M>4.5$.
Fig.~\ref{fig:10percent} to ~\ref{fig:10percent} represent the mean values.
