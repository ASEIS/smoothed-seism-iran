Khodaverdian et al 2016, calculated the seismicity parameters (seismic activity, beta value, maximum regional magnitude) for 1*1 decimal degree. The used the catalog  of 734 B.C. to 2011 AD. The estimated beta value for all points lie between 1.3 to 2.9. The study attempt to derive the earthquake recurrence relationships by using all available records of past earthquake in the Iranian Plateau. They calculated the completeness of the catalog through MAXC method (Wiemer and Wyss, 2000). The Maximum likelihood method (MLM) proposed by kijko and sellovell(1989,1992) and kijko(2000) is utilized to estimate seismicity parameters for both historical and instrumental part of the catalog. They used Shaver et al(2013) magnitude conversion relationships to convert the catalog magnitude into Mw. They used Gardner and knopoff (1974), and the size of spatial and temporal windows of (Van stiphout et al, 2012) for declustering. They calculated the Mc through the ZMAP software by applying the MAXC method, we used the result of Zare et al(2014) which they used the same method. They considered Mw>6.5 as a threshold magnitude for evaluating earthquake probabilities for engineering loss. They used smoothed seismicity method of Frankel et al(2015) with correlation distance of 40 km. They used 4 different attenuation relationship through logic tree approach. The PGA varies from 0.05 g to 0.41g (475) and 0.09 to 0.81g(2475).
