Notes from Khodaverdian et al. (2016)
=====================================

+ Calculated the seismicity parameters (seismic activity, beta value, maximum 
  regional magnitude) for 0.1 degree cells.
- We also used 0.1 degree cells, but we calculated parameters for the regions

+ They used the catalog  of 734 B.C. to 2011 AD 
- We used 550 BC to 2015. 

+ They estimated beta value for all points lie between 1.3 to 2.9. 
- We ... ???

+ Their study attempts to derive the earthquake recurrence relationships 
  by using all available records of past earthquake in the Iranian Plateau. 
- We ... ???

+ They calculated the completeness of the catalog through MAXC method 
  from Wiemer and Wyss (2000).
- We ... ???

+ They used the Maximum likelihood method (MLM) proposed by kijko and Sellovell (1989, 1992) 
  and kijko(2000) to estimate seismicity parameters for both historical and instrumental 
  part of the catalog
- We used the same method. 

+ They used Shaver et al. (2013) magnitude conversion relationships to convert 
  the catalog magnitude into Mw.
- We used Deniz A, Yucemen MS (2010).
- RT: What is the implication of this difference ???

+ They used Gardner and knopoff (1974), and the size of spatial and temporal windows 
  of van Stiphout et al. (2012) for declustering
- We used Gardner and Knopoff (????).
- NK: I am not sure about the parameters I got the code from Chris, I will make sure about that... ???

+ They calculated the Mc through the ZMAP software by applying the MAXC method
- We used the result of Zare et al. (2014), who used the same method. 

+ They considered Mw > 6.5 as a threshold magnitude for evaluating earthquake probabilities
  for engineering loss
- We used Mw > 4.5, and Mw > 5. 
- RT: What is the implication of this difference ???

+ They used smoothed seismicity method of Frankel et al (2015) with correlation distance of 40 km.
- We used the same method but with correlation distance 30 km.
- RT: What is the implication of this difference ???

+ They used 4 different attenuation relationship through logic tree approach
- We used 1 attenuation relationship, as well as standard deviation for each one 
- RT: I do not understand the second part of this sentence

+ The PGA varies from 0.05 g to 0.41g (475-year return period) and 0.09 to 0.81g (2475-year return period).
- We got ... ???
- RT: What are the values in the parentheses ???
