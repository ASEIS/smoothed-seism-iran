\subsection{Completeness}

An important aspect of seismic catalogs is their completeness. This characteristic is measured in terms of the start-year of completeness and the completeness magnitude, which are both parameters that are later used in the seismic analysis process. The start-year of completeness is the point in time at which catalog data exhibit a steady rate of event occurrence or record accumulation for a certain magnitude range, and the completeness magnitude ($M_c$) is the magnitude above which the seismic catalog of a region can be considered complete within a certain time period.

The start-year of completeness is usually identified by inspection. A simple approach used by \citet{Frankel1995} and others is to select the year at which a plot of the cumulative number of events with respect to time becomes (or starts to resemble) a straight line. This is done for different magnitude ranges. Following this approach, we determined the year of completeness for magnitude ranges 3--4, 4--5, 5--6 and 6--7. Our choices are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeness}, where we show the normalized cumulative number of events with time for each of the seismic zones and magnitude ranges, and indicate our selection of the year of completeness in each case. The values shown in this figure and those corresponding to the uniform model of the entire region of interest are summarized in Table \ref{tab:completeness}. For events $M_w>7$, in which case there are no sufficient data to determine a proper threshold, we assumed the catalog to be complete from the earliest time at which there is record of large magnitude earthquakes. 

Determining the completeness magnitude $M_c$, on the other hand, is often determined using simple numerical analysis in combination with data inspection. Two common approaches are maximum curvature and the goodness-of-fit test methods. The maximum curvature method, or MAXC for simplicity, is widely used because as it has been implemented in the ZMAP software package for seismic hazard analysis developed by \citet{Wiemer2001}. \citet{Zare2014}, for instance, used this software to identify $M_c$ values for the different regions of the Middle East. We use the goodness-of-fit test method introduced by \citet{Wiemer2000}, and compute $M_c$ for different catalog-time intervals, namely 1800--1899, 1900--1999, 2000--2015, and for the complete regional catalogs.

We defined these year intervals based on the data magnitude-time distribution (see Fig.~\ref{fig:scatter}) and the idea of distinguishing between historical, early-instrumental, and modern-instrumental catalogs. Having augmented the original catalog with $M>3$ earthquakes beginning in 2000 also influenced our choice of the intervals because at this point the uniformity of the catalog is altered. No value of $M_c$ was computed for pre-historical (before 1800) data because of scarcity of data. Last, we also computed $M_c$ values for the complete regional catalogs, but in this case, in order to maintain uniformity throughout time, we only considered $M>4$ events. Fig.~\ref{fig:mc} illustrates the selection of $M_c$ for the case of the main three northern Iran seismic regions, and Table \ref{tab:completeness} presents the final selection of $M_c$ values for these and the other regions, including the uniform northern Iran model for the complete region of interest.

% A common approach consists on identifying the magnitude associated with the maximum value of the first derivative of the frequency-magnitude curve.

% One of the difficulties in determining completeness is the availability of data for a period of time long enough for all magnitude ranges, so that selection of completeness parameters is reliable.

The values of $M_c$ for different time intervals and seismic regions are used to determine the seismicity Gutenberg-Richter parameters $b$ and $M_{\max}$ (see Section \ref{sec:params}), and the $M_c$ values for the whole regional catalogs and the start-years of completeness are used later for computing the hazard. Admittedly, the choice of the start-years is highly subjective. We should note then, that in the process of choosing the points indicated in the plots shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeness}, we considered additional contributing information such as the history of instrumentation. It is well known that the number of recorded earthquakes increased considerably after the first deployment of seismic instruments in the early 1900s, and later with the establishment of the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network in 1961. We compared our choices with the year thresholds reported by \citet{Zare2014}, which we found to be consistently earlier than our preferred years of completeness. In the end, our selection should lead to a slightly more conservative estimations of hazard. For the case of $M_c$, we compared our results with the values reported by \citet{Karimiparidari2013} and \citet{Khodaverdian_2016_BSSA} and found them to be in general good agreement, despite differences in the spatial definition of the seismic zones.

% Our choice the $M_c$ values by \citet{Karimiparidari2013} over those of \citet{Zare2014} is based on the fact that the former distinguishes Azerbaijan and Alborz as individual seismic zones---as we do---as opposed to the approach followed by the latter, in which these two are a single, larger seismic zone. Both the chosen years of completeness and the values of completeness magnitude for each seismic zone and for the uniform model of the entire region of interest are ....

% For the smoothed seismicity method, completeness of each magnitude in the catalog is an important factor.  \citet{Frankel1995} plotted the cumulative number of events against time for different regions. He assumes that from the point that the line become linear, the catalog is complete. This approach is similar to the MAXC method of ZMAP software \citep{Wiemer2001}, where the completeness treshold is the maximum value of the first derivative of the frequency-magnitude curve. 

% Using the cumulative frequency-magnitude distribution of \citet{Gutenberg1944} and also frequency magnitude distribution approach in software ZMAP, \citet{Zare2014} reported the catalog completeness for the study regions. 

% World widely large earthquakes were routinely located after increasing number of seismic stations establishment in the early 1900s \citep{Shearer2009}. Up to 1961 these data formed the early instrumental period. In 1961 the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN) was stablished. The record of these seismographs considerably improved the seismic catalogs in different part of the world \citep{Shearer2009}. Fig.~\ref{fig:completness_scatter} shows the magnitude distribution of events with respect to the time of occurrence of the events.

% We pick the Mw 0.5 increments in magnitude to be able to compare the results with \citet{Zare2014}. In order to be able to compare the results with \citet{Zare2014} we merge the data of Azerbaijan and Alborz seismic regions.  Fig.~\ref{fig:completness_compare_zare_2014_Az_Al} shows the completeness of catalog for earthquakes with different magnitude range in Azerbaijan-Alborz region. According to this figure, midrange magnitudes ($ 4 < Mw < 6 $) fairly obey the network developments in 1900 and 1961. The completeness thresholds for each magnitude range which are reported by \citet{Zare2014} are shown by dashed green line. 

% In this study we follow the \citet{Frankel1995} approach to determine the completeness of each region. Even though the approach used by \citet{Frankel1995} will lead to the conservative results, we make sure that we don't use a period of time without knowing the complete number of events. Determining the completeness of the catalog is very sensitive to the data. Converting earthquake magnitudes from different scales to moment magnitude obviously has some error. Having broader range of magnitude will help to minimize these sort of error. In this study we consider the magnitude intervals for completeness study as $Mw = 1$.
