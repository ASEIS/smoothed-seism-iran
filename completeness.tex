\subsection{Completeness}

An important aspect of seismic catalogs is their completeness.  Completeness is is measured both in terms of the year of completeness and the completeness magnitude. Both are used in the seismic analysis process. The year of completeness is the point in time at which catalog data exhibits a steady rate of event occurrence. This is measured for different magnitude ranges. A simple approach used by \citet{Frankel1995} and others is to identify the year at which a plot of the cumulative number of events with respect to time becomes (or at least, resembles) a straight line. 

The completeness magnitude, on the other hand, is the minimum magnitude at which the seismic catalog of a region can be considered complete within a certain time period. While the year of completeness can be determined by inspection of the data, the completeness magnitude requires a numerical analysis of the catalog. A common approach is to identify the magnitude associated with the maximum value of the first derivative of the frequency-magnitude curve. This method is widely used as implemented in the ZMAP software package for seismic hazard analysis developed by \citet{Wiemer2001}.

One of the difficulties in determining completeness is the availability of data for a long-enough period of time for all magnitude ranges. In this study, we determined the year of completeness for magnitude ranges 3--4, 4--5, 5--6 and 6--7 by inspection, following the approach used by \citet{Frankel1995}. This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:completeness}, where we show the cumulative number of events with time for each of the seismic zones and magnitude ranges, and indicate our choice of completeness year thresholds. For events $M_w>7$, in which case there are no sufficient data to determine a proper threshold, we assumed the catalog to be complete from the earliest time at which there is record of large magnitude earthquakes. 

The chosen years of completeness are compiled in Table \ref{tab:completeness}. Also shown in this table are the values of completeness magnitude for each seismic zone and for the uniform model of the entire region of interest. 


... \citet{Zare} provide the years for catalog completeness in their the original catalog for the different regions in their study on the seismicity of the Middle East. They used the 





% For the smoothed seismicity method, completeness of each magnitude in the catalog is an important factor.  \citet{Frankel1995} plotted the cumulative number of events against time for different regions. He assumes that from the point that the line become linear, the catalog is complete. This approach is similar to the MAXC method of ZMAP software \citep{Wiemer2001}, where the completeness treshold is the maximum value of the first derivative of the frequency-magnitude curve. 

% Using the cumulative frequency-magnitude distribution of \citet{Gutenberg1944} and also frequency magnitude distribution approach in software ZMAP, \citet{Zare2014} reported the catalog completeness for the study regions. 

% World widely large earthquakes were routinely located after increasing number of seismic stations establishment in the early 1900s \citep{Shearer2009}. Up to 1961 these data formed the early instrumental period. In 1961 the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN) was stablished. The record of these seismographs considerably improved the seismic catalogs in different part of the world \citep{Shearer2009}. Fig.~\ref{fig:completness_scatter} shows the magnitude distribution of events with respect to the time of occurrence of the events.

% We pick the Mw 0.5 increments in magnitude to be able to compare the results with \citet{Zare2014}. In order to be able to compare the results with \citet{Zare2014} we merge the data of Azerbaijan and Alborz seismic regions.  Fig.~\ref{fig:completness_compare_zare_2014_Az_Al} shows the completeness of catalog for earthquakes with different magnitude range in Azerbaijan-Alborz region. According to this figure, midrange magnitudes ($ 4 < Mw < 6 $) fairly obey the network developments in 1900 and 1961. The completeness thresholds for each magnitude range which are reported by \citet{Zare2014} are shown by dashed green line. 

% In this study we follow the \citet{Frankel1995} approach to determine the completeness of each region. Even though the approach used by \citet{Frankel1995} will lead to the conservative results, we make sure that we don't use a period of time without knowing the complete number of events. Determining the completeness of the catalog is very sensitive to the data. Converting earthquake magnitudes from different scales to moment magnitude obviously has some error. Having broader range of magnitude will help to minimize these sort of error. In this study we consider the magnitude intervals for completeness study as $Mw = 1$.
