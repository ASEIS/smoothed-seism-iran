\section{Completeness tests}
For the smoothed seismicity method, completeness of each magnitude in the catalog is an important factor. To access catalog completeness, according to \citet{Frankel1995}, we made plots of the cumulative number of events against time for different regions.   Fig.~\ref{fig:comptest} shows the completeness of data for each magnitude threshold in three different regions.
A uniform rise of cumulative number of earthquake in each magnitude big, defines the threshold for catalog completeness.

We assume the catalog for earthquakes with magnitude greater than $M_w=7$ is complete from the first historical earthquake report. Table 1 presents the completeness of catalog of each region for different moment magnitudes.
