In this study we conduct a new probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for northern Iran, using recently confirmed ground motion prediction equations and updated seismic catalogs. We evaluate seismic hazard over three tectonic seismic zones (Alborz Mountain Range, Azerbaijan and Kopeh-Dagh) using smoothed historical seismicity. In this model, events are not assigned to specific faults and are assumed to be potential seismogenic sources, spatially gridded to cells. We decluster historical and instrumental seismicity to compute the rate of earthquakes in each grid, and smooth these rates to account for uncertainty in the spatial distribution of future earthquakes. We assume each grid cell has spacing of $0.1^{\circ}$ in latitude and $0.1^{\circ}$ in longitude and count the number of earthquakes in each of them. We use Gaussian filter to smooth the fraction of earthquakes in incremental intervals of magnitude. For this article, in order to consider the seismicity rate, we consider all historical and instrumental earthquakes with magnitude above 3. To calculate the seismic hazard we defined two models based on structural damage threshold magnitude, including Mw 4.5 and Mw 5 with weight of 0.3 and 0.7, respectively. Seismicity parameters are calculated for each seismic region, and smoothed seismicity is calculated separately for each.  We add the probability of exceedance of all regions and present the smoothed seismicity hazard in northern Iran. The horizontal peak ground acceleration is selected as the ground motion parameter. The results are assessed in terms of the expected peak ground acceleration (PGA) with a 10\% and 2\% probability of exceedance in 50 years for rock site conditions. The seismic hazard map for northern Iran is presented. The maximum seismic hazard values are 0.44 $g$ and  0.74 $g$ for 10\% and 2\% probability in exceedance in 50 years, which are calculated in both Azerbaijan and Alborz tectonic seismic region. The result of 10\% probability of exceedance in 50 years are in close agreement with current Iranian code of practice for seismic design of building.
